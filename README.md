# Project: Azure Database Migration
This project involves the architecture and implementation of a cloud-based database system on Microsoft Azure. It showcases hands-on expertise in cloud engineering, focusing on data management, disaster recovery, and security.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need a Microsoft Azure account. Detailed instructions on setting up the environment and implementing the features will be provided in the subsequent sections.

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Azure account
- Basic understanding of cloud engineering and database management

## Milestone 2: Set up the Production Environment

### Task 1: Provision a Windows Virtual Machine
- Provision a Windows VM in Azure.
- Configure the VM based on your requirements.

### Task 2: Connect to the Windows Virtual Machine
- Use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to connect to the VM.
- Ensure your network settings allow RDP connections.

### Task 3: Install SQL Server and SSMS
- Download and install SQL Server on your VM.
- Download and install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

### Task 4: Create the Production Database
- Use SSMS to create a new SQL Server database.
- Configure the database based on your requirements.

### Features
 1. Production Environment Database: Establish a production environment database that will be migrated to Azure SQL Database.

2. Data Backup and Restoration: Focus on crucial aspects like data backup and restoration, including automated scheduling.

3. Disaster Recovery Scenario: Simulate a disaster recovery scenario with potential data loss, exploring the complexities of geo-replication and failover configuration to ensure data availability under challenging conditions.

4. Security: Enhance security through Microsoft Entra ID integration to define access roles, adding an extra layer of control and protection.
